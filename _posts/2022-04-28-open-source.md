Exactly one month since my first post.

Tried to get started on contributing to open source issues on GitHub. Had a call with Chris to help me get started. 

Didn't actually make a contribution but got familiar with finding issues by labels, and sifting through the list to find something that may be in my scope/worth my effort (beginner/easy/good first issue feel varied and unspecific).

Found a couple of duds that either had prerequisites that weren't worth setting up or couldn't be recreated, but it was good to poke around and get an idea of how to find issues to work on.

Before getting off the call with Chris, he suggested reaching out to a friend of his who owns a repo that may have issues I can work on. I joined their Discord and spoke to the friend about possibly helping out. I'll be spending some time tomorrow and possibly over the weekend to poke around the app and see if I can make any contributions.

All in all, good to get exposed to this stuff and hopefully I can make some contributions soon. Even better if I can make a habit of it.
