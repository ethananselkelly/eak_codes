Hi, I'm Ethan Ansel-Kelly. Living in Brighton, MA (read Boston). I recently decided to change careers, learn web development, and become a software engineer. It's an exciting new journey, and I've only just started.

Lately most of my working hours are spent looking for that first job after completing my coding bootcamp. Ideally something fullstack but most importantly something where I can maximize my growth as a developer.

Here's a non-comprehensive list of things I care about:
-Family and friends :)
-Gaming and esports
-Food in every way possible
-Exercising
-Environmentalism
-Live music
-Getting out of the city now and then

You can reach me via email, GitHub, or LinkedIn. As they say: DMs are open.
